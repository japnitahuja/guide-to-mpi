## hello_world.c
This code is a simple example of an MPI program in C that prints a "Hello world" message from each process in the MPI communicator.

After initializing the MPI environment using MPI_Init(), the program gets the rank of the current process and the total number of processes using MPI_Comm_rank() and MPI_Comm_size(), respectively. It then prints a message to the console using printf() that includes the process rank and total number of processes.

Finally, the program finalizes the MPI environment using MPI_Finalize() and returns 0.

When this program is run on multiple processes using an MPI launcher like mpirun or mpiexec, each process will print its own message to the console. The order in which the messages are printed is not guaranteed, as the processes can execute in any order.
